linux patcher by rofl0r

tested with 31.14, 31.16, 31.17, 31.18, 31.19, 31.21, 31.22, 31.24, 31.25, 
34.02, 34.03, 34.06, 34.10 - OK

the 34.x series brings some new stuff, needs incompatible change. 
checkout git commit be1a145e3458e106bb62835195858712030b3d37 for 31.xx

* get dwarf fortress linux from bay12 website
* extract it somewhere
* copy/extract everything here into your dwarf fortress folder
* run mayday-patch.sh

after that you can port your worlds/saves/etc and have Fun.

how to port your savegame
=========================
* copy your data/save folder to your new DF directory.
* cd into it, delete region1/raw.
* copy raw from DF base folder into your region1 folder - done.

how to create a platform independant DFG package for redistribution
(without need to redistribute the DF binaries)
===================================================================
* after you have tested the patch on the newest DF and it applied successfully,
* unzip/tar the newest DF to some folder. it doesnt matter which platform's version it is.
* run utils/clean.sh on that folder ( utils/clean.sh /path/to/DF )
* copy everything from this repo into that folder
* run mayday-patch.sh
* you can now compress that folder with the packer of your choice and redistribute it.
  the filesize should be around 700KB, since the game binaries are not inside.
